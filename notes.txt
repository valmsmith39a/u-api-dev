API: Application Programming Interface: created to help 2 different systems interact with one another 

APIS:
  Doesn't expose application implementation
  Controlled exposure of your application and your data
  Standardized way of accessing data

Examples:
  Google Maps
  Stripe
  Facebook
  Instagram
  Spotify

How APIs Work:
  Ex
  client banker vault 
  
  client api server database

  client sends a request 

  server parses the request

  server returns the response back to the client 

  client renders the response

Internet Protocols

  Internet Protocol (IP): protocol for sending data from one computer to another across the internet 
    IP Address: 
      Unique from computer to computer

  Other protocols:
    TCP: Transmission Control Protocol: Used for data transmission but for a different layer of internet
    File Transfer Protocol (FTP): transfer files between server and client 

    HTTP: Hypertext Transmission Protocl: transmitting text and hyperlinks 

    Different layers of internet: https://blog.postman.com/intro-to-apis-what-is-an-api/

**API handles HTTP requests and HTTP functions over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

RESTful APIs

REpresentational State Transfer 

Architectural style used by RESTful APIs

Roy Fielding in 2000

Key principles:
  Uniform Interface: Resources, Representation and Self Description Messages
    Resources
    Representation:
      What information
      How it's shaped
      What does client need to see, only send what they need
      format: text, HTML, json
      send description info so client knows how to parse
  Stateless: Self-contained requests
    Each request is standalone
    One request is not based on another 
    Client does not need to store application data to make subsequent requests 
  Client-Server: must be both client/server in architecture
  Cacheable and Layered System:
    Makes network more efficient 
    Can cache (store) information 

Summary of REST principles:
  Uniform Interface:
    standardized way of accessing and processing data resources
    unique URLs, self description messages in server response that describe how to process the representation (JSON vs XML) of the data resource

  Stateless:
    Every client request is self-contained (server doesn't need to store any applicatioin data in order to respond to subsequent requests)

    **stateless servers make application scalable 
    
  Client-Server: client/server must exist in architecture

  Cacheable and Layered Systems: to increase networking efficiency

API Server:
  How to receive requests
  Parse those requests 
  Send responses well formatted and informative for the client 
  
  Middleman between client and data 
  Maintain data integrity
  Communication to client is clear/well documented 
  Data secured and used by many clients

Lesson Outline

  HTTP Basics
    Methods, Requests, Responses, Status Codes

  Flask Microframework
    basic endpoints
    testing response using Curl 

HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
  Foundation of internet communication since 1990
  Features
    Connectionless
      For each request/response pair between client and 
      server, there this 1 connection. 
        request - opens a connection
        response - closes the connection 
        when connection is open, there are ports on client and server that are occupied. only keep those ports occupied when there is a request/response interaction. 

    Stateless
      No link between successive requests
      One request does not impact next request
      A lot easier to debug if request fails 
      ***is NOT sessionless
      Has sessions: share the same context across different requests 
      As navigate on a site, you're in the same session (headers/cookies/caching, can create a sessions that are shared across those requests, give the same context. 

    Media independent
      Any type of data can be sent with HTTP
      Client/Server must know how to process that info 
      Message must identify, what is the Content Type (text/html/json), so client/server know how to process the data. 
    
    Elements:
      URI: Uniform Resource Identifier
        Specific address for resource that you want 
      Messages: Requests/Response 
        URLs (address of resource) are type of URI (name or address of resource)

    Status Codes:
      Response is sent with a status code: 200, 404 etc.

Summary: 
  HTTP Features:
    Connectionless: 
      Client/Server only maintain a connection during the response and request. 
      Client sends a request - connection opens 
      Client receives a response from the Server - connection is closed 

    Stateless:
      No dependency between successive requests

    Not Sessionless:
      Headers/cookies used to create sessions to enable HTTP requests to share the same context 

    Media Independent: any type of data sent over HTTP as long as client/server know how to handle the data format. Will be using JSON data format. 

 Elements:
  Universal Resource Identifier
    Scheme: specifies the protocol: http
    Host: specifies the host that holds the resource: www.example.com
    Path: specifies the resource requested, /tasks
    Query: optional component - query string provides information resource can use such as search parameter. /term=homeowork

Overview of http https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview

HTTP Request Elements
  GET http://www.example.com/tasks?term=homework

  GET: method 
  Path: http://wwww.example.com/tasks?term=homework
  HTTP/2.0: HTTP version
  Accept-Language: en - Headers (optional) 

  GET /tasks?term=homework HTTP/2.0

  GET: Method
  Path: /tasks?term=homework
  Host: http://www.example.com
  Headers: Accept-Language: en

HTTP Requests
  GET: only retrieves information for the request resource of the given URI

  POST: Send data to the server to create a new resource

  PUT: Replaces all of the representation of the target resource with the request data (ex text but no image sent, replaces the whole thing, so now image is lost) 

  PATCH: partially modifies representation of the target resource with the request data. (ex text but now image sent, updates the text and leaves image alone)

  DELETE: removes entire representtion of the resource

  OPTIONS: Sends communication options for the requested resource 

HTTP Requests Summary:
  Elements:
    Method: operation to be performed 
    Path: URL of resource to be fetched, excluding scheme and host 
    HTTP:Version
    Headers: optional info ex Accept-Language
    Body: optional information usually for POST/PATCH - contains resource sent to server 

  Request Methods: 
    GET: retrieves info
    POST: sends data to create a new resource
    PUT: Replaces all representation with request data
    PATCH: Partially modifies represenatation 
    DELETE: Removes all representation of resource 
    OPTIONS: Ssends communication options for requested resource

Introduction to Flask
  Flask: Microframework that is simple and extensible
  Create basic flask application 
  Write basic endpoint
  Curl/Chrome Dev Tools to check 

Chrome Dev Tools

Network Tab 

Name: endpoint to get requested resource

Status of that request 

Type: type of the Media

Time: how much time endpoint takes is important.

Request URL

Request Method: Ex GET

Curl: look at what endpoint returning 

command line tool 

make requests to various endpoints 

curl -X POST <url>

-X: command line option 

POST: Method 

Ex 

curl https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/currency/cop

curl --help 

Curl Command Line Options 

Option Long form         Example 
-X     --request COMMAND curl -x POST <url>
-d     --data DATA            curl -d '{"name": "Bob"}' <url>
-F     --form CONTENT         curl -X POST -F "name=user" <url>
-u     --user USER[:PASSWORD] curl --user bob:secret <url>  


Try piping the output to the jq, a command-line JSON processor, as shown below:
curl https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/move/47 | jq '.'

Endpoints and Payloads 

Organizing API Endpoints 

Handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing 

Parsing request path and body 

Flask and POST, PATCH and DELETE requests 

Handling Errors 

Flask-CORS 

How to Organize API Endpoints 

	Should be intuitive 

	Organize by resource 

	*** Use nouns in path not verbs *** 

		BAD: 
				https://example.com/create-tasks 
			https://example.com/send 

		GOOD:
			https://example.com/tasks
			https://example.com/messages 

		
		Use Methods like GET, POST for verbs for the endpoints 

		Want to GET https://example.com/tasks # want to GET tasks 

	Keep a consistent scheme 
		
		Plural nouns for collections 

		Use a parameter to specify an item 

		BAD: 
			https://example.com/user/task/ # this is BAD for specifying 1 item 

	  GOOD: 
			https://example.com/users/1/tasks 
		
	Don't make endpoints too complex or lengthy 

		No longer than 3 

			collection/item/collection 

		  BAD 
				https://example.com/users/1/tasks/8/notes

			GOOD 
				https://example.com/tasks/8/notes # All the notes with id of 8 
				https://example.com/users/1/tasks # All tasks for user 1 

/tasks GET all tasks 

/tasks/1 GET the details of task 1

/tasks/1/notes Get all the notes for task 1 


Cross Origin Resource Sharing 

URL of web app is different origin of api 

Cross Origin Resource Sharing needed to make API call to another origin 

CORS
	Security and the Same-Origin Policy (web browser allows scripts in one page to access data in another page, 
		but only if they share the same origin)   
	Block requests from rogue JavaScript

	Triggered when: 
		Different domains 
		Different subdomains (example.com and api.example.com) 
		Different ports 
		Different protocols

		Different domains
		Different subdomains (example.com and api.example.com)
		Different ports (example.com and example.com:1234)
		Different protocols (http://example.com and https://example.com)

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: What client domains can access its resources 
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: If using cookies for authentication
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: List of HTTP methods allowed

CORS headers to specify what server will allow: 

Access-Contro-Allow-Origin
	What client domains can access its resources. For any domain use * 

Access-Control-Allow-Credentials	
	Only if using cookies for authentication - in which case its value must be true 

Access-Control-Allow-Methods 
	List of HTTP request types allowed 

Access-Control-Allow-Headers
	List of http request header values the server will allow particularly useful if use any custom headers  

**
Flask CORS
In order to install Flask-CORS simply run
pip3 install -U flask-cors

Once Flask-CORS is installed, you simply import the CORS function and call it with your app instance as a parameter. This will initialize Flask-CORS will all default options.
from flask_cors import CORS
app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=True)
CORS(app)

Resource-Specific Usage There are multiple options you can use to specify your Flask-CORS behavior. One typical one is resources, which contains a dictionary whose keys are regular expressions and values are dictionary or kwargs
cors = CORS(app, resources={r"/api/*": {"origins": "*"}})

If you need to enable CORS on a given route, like those non-simple requests, you can use @cross_origin() to enable it.

@app.route("/hello")
@cross_origin()
def get_greeting():
 return jsonify({'message':'Hello, World!'})

from flask import Flask, jsonify
from models import setup_db, Plant
from flask_cors import CORS, cross_origin

def create_app(test_config=None):
    app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=True)
    setup_db(app)
    #CORS(app, resources={r"*/api/*" : {origins: '*'}})
    CORS(app)

    @app.after_request
    def after_request(response):
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization')
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, OPTION')
        return response

    #@cross_origin
    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
        return jsonify({'message':'HELLO, WORLD!'})
    return app

Create the database - Create the database and a user. Run the following:

# Connect to the PostgreSQL
psql postgres
# Create the database,  *plantsdb*, and create a user `student`. Grant all privileges to the student
\i plantsdb_setup.sql
# Exit the PostgreSQL prompt
\q

# Mac users
psql -f plants.psql -U student -d plantsdb
# Linux users
su - postgres bash -c "psql plantsdb < /path/to/plants.psql"

**

GET with parameters and pagination 
POST 
PATCH
DELETE 
Basic Error Handling 

Flask Routes 

Extended:
Variable Rules 
	http://www.example.com/entrees/1
	@app.route('/entrees/<int:entree_id>')

	converter syntax:
		<converter.variable_name>

Methods 
	@app.route('/hello', methods=['GET, 'POST'])
	def greeting():
		if request.method == 'POST':
			return create_greeting()
		else:
			return send_greeting()

Pagination 

Query parameters 

https://example.come/entrees?page=1&allergens=peanuts

On flask end 

@app.route('/entrees', methods=['GET']
	def get_entrees():
		page = request.args.get('page', 1, type=int)

When handling large collections of data, serialize/send all data to 
frontend will slow down the response and rendering to the client 

Common way to handle the issue is to paginate the data you're sending 
and send it in chunks instead 

CORS

endpoints CRUD

pagination

@app.errorhandling

curl to test 

***
API TESTING
**

Define test case class

Define / implement the setUp function: runs before each test 
  initialize app 

Define the tearDown method: runs after each test

Define tests 

Run the test suite

class AppNameTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    """This class represents the ___ test case"""

    def setUp(self):
        """Executed before each test. Define test variables and initialize app."""
        self.client = app.test_client
        pass

    def tearDown(self):
        """Executed after reach test"""
        pass

    def test_given_behavior(self):
        """Test _____________ """
        res = self.client().get('/')

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, 200)

# Make the tests conveniently executable
if __name__ == "__main__":
unittest.main()


Test Driven Development 

Write test 
  What is the expected behavior 
  What assumptions 

Fail Test 
  Should fail the test 

Write code 
  
Pass Test 

Refactor

Benefits of TDD
1. Define expected behavior
2. Concise code 
3. Keeps development cycle short and rapid
